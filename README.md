===========

C++ graphs implementation for a school C++ and Design Patterns course.

Usage:

* To build the lib, just issue ```make lib```.
* To build the testcases, issue ```make``` (if necessary, the lib shall be rebuilt).
* You can write and build your own testcase by hand, but the compiler arguments 
  are a bit complex (due to the project constraints), so you better write it,
  move it into `src/examples`, and issue ```make```.
